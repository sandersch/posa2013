## Week 2 Peer Assessment #1

### Assignment Description

Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the videos on Operating System (OS) Support for Programming Concurrent and Networked Software explore mechanisms for communication, concurrency, and synchronization that are common across mainstream operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, Solaris, etc.). Many operating systems offer other OS-specific mechanisms (such as Windows I/O completion ports, the UNIX System V semaphores, the Linux epoll() event muxing function, etc.) that provide additional functional and performance capabilities than the ones we discussed in these videos. Write a short (e.g., 300-400 word) essay that evaluates the pros and cons of using these additional capabilities in your software. You might also want to discuss techniques for minimizing the impact of these OS-specific mechanisms if you're familiar with them.
