## Week 2 Peer Assessment #3

### Assignment Description

Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the videos on an Overview of Patterns emphasize the importance of understanding design knowledge to become a master software developer.  Mature engineering disciplines have handbooks that codify design knowledge in a manner that presents successful solutions to known problems.  For instance, automobile designers don't design cars using the laws of physics.  Instead, they reuse standard designs with successful track records since the extra few percent of performance available by starting from scratch typically isn't worth the cost.  Write a short (e.g., 300-400 word) essay that explains why design knowledge has historically not been widely captured and disseminated in the software profession.  Your essay should also briefly consider various ways of codifying this knowledge more effectively than is often done in practice today.
