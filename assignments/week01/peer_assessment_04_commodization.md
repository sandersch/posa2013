## Week 1 Peer Assessment #4

### Assignment Description

Part 2 of the video on an Overview of Concurrent and Networked Software Layers explores the consequences of the commoditization that is occurring at many levels of hardware and software stacks. Write a short (e.g., 300-400 word) essay that summarizes your experiences with the effects of commoditization on the software profession (including experiences you may have as a student).  Your essay should emphasize the opportunities and limitations stemming from commoditization, as well as outlining strategies you deem useful to adapt to commoditization throughout your career.

If you are a student (or a novice developer) with little/no personal experience please (1) note this in your answer and (2) do your best to summarize what you expect the impact of commoditization to be on your career.
