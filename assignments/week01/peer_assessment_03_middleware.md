## Week 1 Peer Assessment #3

### Assignment Description

Part 1 of the video on an Overview of Concurrent and Networked Software Layers explores various capabilities provided at different levels of abstraction, including operating systems, network protocols, and middleware.  Write a short (e.g., 300-400 word) essay that summarizes the key benefits and limitation of middleware.  Your essay should address tradeoffs between forces like portability vs performance, development vs. sustainment effort, ease of hiring developers who know off-the-shelf middleware vs. competitive advantages of providing custom proprietary solutions.
