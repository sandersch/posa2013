## Week 3 Peer Assessment #2

### Assignment Description

Part 1 of the video on the Overview of Pattern Relations compares pattern collections with other (more advanced) forms of pattern relations, such as pattern complements, pattern compounds, pattern sequences, and pattern languages.  Despite nearly two decades of time elapsing since the publication of the GoF book, however, most patterns are still documented and learned in terms of pattern collections.  Write a short (e.g., 300-400 word) essay that gives your assessment of why pattern collections composed of largely "stand-alone" patterns are still the primary way we document and learn patterns.  Your essay should consider various factors, including scope of the patterns, level of effort, and culture.
